Xcode commandline: We need to use manual signing

uuid is provisioning's unique id:  get by opening in textedit

Just to archive (not for IPA), xcode checks first if provisioning is set in xcode settings. (need to fake it?)

xcode commandline tool sign in the .archive package with specified profile in exportOptions.plist, And The provisioning profile must be present 
in ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles (the default paths of provisionings where xcode put all its provisionings)


Make provisioning profile for specific appID in developer portal -> download it, and specify it in exportOptions.plit, then copy it under ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning, only then xcode9 is able to sign IPA, manually
